1
00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:30.952
Ta-da!

2
00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:32.165
Ta-da!

3
00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.750
Ta-da! Ta...
Ta-da!

4
00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.120
Ta-da!

5
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:38.622
Ta-da!

6
00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:02.710
Huh?

7
00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:18.495
Three weeks, and we're
still no closer to cracking this.

8
00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:21.494
Right, bring him in!

9
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.912
Yes, sir.

10
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.154
This is the best party ever!

11
00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.204
Yeah!

12
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.963
Ha!

13
00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.431
Oh, no!
A dragon is approaching!

14
00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:30.025
Fear not, for here come the
gallant knights to save us.

15
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.195
Yay!

16
00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:50.666
No, no, no. What do you
mean she's not coming?

17
00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:53.590
I have a backyard full
of these little girls

18
00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:57.802
who are counting on a visit
from a fairy princess.

19
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.725
Hurts! Stop it!

20
00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:08.642
Listen! I don't want a refund,
I want the fairy princess,

21
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.107
Please, I'm begging you.

22
00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.613
You know what? I hope that
you can sleep at night,

23
00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:16.116
you crusher of
little girls' dreams!

24
00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:17.359
Ooh, ooh!

25
00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:18.819
When's the fairy
princess coming?

26
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.534
Any minute now!

27
00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:23.578
Yay!

28
00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:25.241
Stall them!

29
00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:30.585
Ooh!

30
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.093
Whoa! Whoa, okay!
Okay, all right.

31
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.807
That's enough of
the magic show.

32
00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:45.929
Aw!

33
00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.192
Wait, did you hear that?

34
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.980
It sounded like the twinkling
sounds of magical fairy dust.

35
00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.527
It's the fairy
princess! She's coming!

36
00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.700
Look!

37
00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.585
- Huh? Oh!
- Eh?

38
00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.917
Ow!

39
00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:18.462
Ow.

40
00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:29.936
It is I, Gruzinkerbell,

41
00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:34.436
the most magical
fairy princess of all!

42
00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:38.611
And I am here to
wish Princess Agnes

43
00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:40.992
a very happy birthday!

44
00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.986
How come you're so fat?

45
00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.371
Because

46
00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:48.082
my house is made of candy,

47
00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:52.087
and sometimes I eat
instead of facing my problems!

48
00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:54.665
How come you have...

49
00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.507
Okay, time for cake.

50
00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:57.792
Yay!

51
00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:04.637
Thank you, Gruzinkerbell! You're
the best fairy princess ever!

52
00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:08.058
You are welcome, little girl!

53
00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:14.185
I know it's really you, Gru. I'm
just pretending for the other kids.

54
00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.817
Hey there, Gru. Mr. Life of the Party!

55
00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.451
Hello, Jillian.

56
00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:26.697
So, I'm gonna go
out on a limb here,

57
00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:32.836
but my friend Natalie is
recently single, and... Oop.

58
00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:35.710
No, no, no, get off the limb right now.
No limb.

59
00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.170
Come on, she's a riot!

60
00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:41.303
She sings karaoke,
she has a lot of free time,

61
00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.055
looks aren't that
important to her...

62
00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:48.219
No, Jills, that is not happening.
Seriously, I'm fine.

63
00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:50.763
Okay, fine, forget Natalie.
How about my cousin Linda?

64
00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:51.937
No!

65
00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:54.729
Oh! Oh! I know someone whose
husband just died...

66
00:07:57.394 --> 00:08:00.022
I'm sorry,
I did not see you there.

67
00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.321
Or there.

68
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:15.078
Kyle? Kyle?

69
00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:17.581
Kyle, no! Do not do your
business on the petunias!

70
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.923
There you go.
Those are Fred's, go crazy.

71
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:28.387
Good boy!

72
00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:29.600
Mr. Gru?

73
00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:30.848
I didn't...
What? Yes?

74
00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:35.936
Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde
of the AVL.

75
00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:39.277
Oh, whoops!

76
00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:41.738
Sorry, you're gonna
have to come with me.

77
00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:44.282
Oh, sorry, I...
Freeze ray!

78
00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.071
You know, you really
should announce

79
00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:52.123
your weapons after
you fire them, Mr. Gru.

80
00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:53.700
For example...

81
00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:58.672
Lipstick taser!

82
00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:01.379
Oh, it works so good.

83
00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.052
Man!

84
00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:15.309
Large person.

85
00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.776
Oh, sorry.

86
00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:29.820
Get in there...
Huh?

87
00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:32.663
...you big man!

88
00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.580
Boss!

89
00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:54.682
Uh? Huh!

90
00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:00.851
Whoa!

91
00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:03.440
Huh?

92
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.193
Ah! Whoo!

93
00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.482
Ooh!

94
00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.214
Oh!

95
00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:30.631
Huh? Ah. Quack, quack!

96
00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:44.003
Wow!

97
00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.255
What? Where?

98
00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:34.261
Whoa, foot is asleep.

99
00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:37.474
Ah, pins and needles!

100
00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:39.391
Good afternoon,
Mr. Gru.

101
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:40.556
Eh.

102
00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:43.521
I apologize for our methods
in getting you here.

103
00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.266
I don't. I'd do it
again in a heartbeat.

104
00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:48.022
I am not gonna lie,
I enjoyed that.

105
00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:50.736
Every second of it. Gave me
a bit of a buzz, actually.

106
00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:52.571
That's enough, Agent Wilde.

107
00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:53.944
Sorry, sir.

108
00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.570
Okay, this is bogus!

109
00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.822
I don't know who you people
think you are, but...

110
00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:02.373
We are
the Anti-Villain League.

111
00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:07.921
An ultra-secret organization dedicated
to fighting crime on a global scale.

112
00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:13.134
Rob a bank, we're not interested.
Kill someone, not our deal.

113
00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:18.056
But you want to melt the polar ice
caps, or vaporize Mount Fuji,

114
00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:21.809
or even steal the Moon...

115
00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:24.224
Then we notice.

116
00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:27.273
First of all, you got
no proof that I did that.

117
00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:31.187
Second, after I did
do that, I put it back!

118
00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:32.984
We're well aware of that,
Mr. Gru.

119
00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:35.064
That's why we brought you here.

120
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:39.202
I am the League's director,
Silas Ramsbottom.

121
00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:40.903
Bottom.

122
00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:46.534
Hilarious.

123
00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:48.290
Agent Wilde?

124
00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:49.754
Oh, me now? Ah.

125
00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:51.831
Um, recently,
an entire top-secret lab

126
00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:53.791
disappeared from
the Arctic Circle.

127
00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:57.379
Yeah, the entire lab, just...

128
00:13:57.462 --> 00:13:59.590
Gone. Where did it go?

129
00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.091
I don't care.

130
00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:03.684
Hmm. The lab was
devoted to experiments

131
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.014
involving PX-41,
a transmutation serum.

132
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.105
What is PX-41, you ask?
Mmm, it's pretty bad. Look.

133
00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.279
Ah!

134
00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:33.752
Huh, you usually don't
see that in bunnies.

135
00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:37.836
As you can see, in the wrong
hands, the PX-41 serum

136
00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:41.014
could be the most devastating
weapon on Earth.

137
00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:47.266
Fortunately, it has a very
distinct chemical footprint.

138
00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:50.440
And using the latest
chem-tracking technology,

139
00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:53.685
we found traces of it
in the Paradise Mall.

140
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.153
A mall?

141
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:57.863
Precisely. And we
believe that one of these

142
00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:00.408
shop owners is
a master criminal.

143
00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:01.700
And that's where you come in.

144
00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:06.164
As an ex-villain, you know how a
villain thinks, how a villain acts.

145
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.248
The plan is to set
you up undercover

146
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.292
at a shop in the mall,
where hopefully...

147
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:13.289
Okay, I see
where this is going,

148
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:16.716
with all the <i>Mission: Impossible</i>
stuff, but no. No!

149
00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:20.508
I'm a father now.
And a legitimate businessman.

150
00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:24.303
I am developing a line
of delicious jams and jellies.

151
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.768
"Jams and jellies"?

152
00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:30.768
Oh, attitude!
That's right!

153
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.815
So, thanks, but no thanks.

154
00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:38.689
And here's a tip. Instead of
tasing people and kidnapping them,

155
00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:41.362
maybe you should
just give them a call!

156
00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.694
Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt.

157
00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:45.035
Ramsbottom.

158
00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:47.037
Oh, yeah,
like that's any better.

159
00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:49.249
Hello.

160
00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:03.216
Look, I probably shouldn't
be saying this,

161
00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:06.223
but your work as a villain
was kind of amazing.

162
00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:10.558
So, if you ever wanna get back
to doing something awesome,

163
00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:13.355
give us a call.

164
00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:34.794
Hey, I told you
guys to get to bed.

165
00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:36.078
Oh, sorry.

166
00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:37.706
So, when you going
on your date?

167
00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:38.960
What?

168
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:41.129
Remember, Miss Jillian said she
was arranging a date for you.

169
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:45.255
Yeah, well, she is a nut job,
and I'm not going on any date.

170
00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:47.465
Why not? Are you scared?

171
00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:57.399
Hey, did you guys see
the Moon landing on TV?

172
00:16:57.558 --> 00:17:00.107
Yeah, I can't believe it.
It's so cool!

173
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:01.646
Excuse me? Lisa?

174
00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:02.981
I was talking to
Billy the other day.

175
00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:04.152
No way!

176
00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:05.570
He is so cute.

177
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.745
Ah. Hey, Lisa,
I was wondering if you...

178
00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:13.074
Ew! Gru touched Lisa!
Gru touched Lisa!

179
00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:14.454
Ew!

180
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.832
Lisa's got Gruties!

181
00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:28.093
Scared? Of what? Women?
No! That's bonkers!

182
00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:32.427
I just have no interest in going on
a date, that's all. Case closed.

183
00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:35.847
I'm not scared.
Of women. Or dates.

184
00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:37.565
Let's go to bed.

185
00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.359
Good night, Edith.

186
00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:44.068
Good night, Margo.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

187
00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:46.069
Hold the horses.
Who are you texting?

188
00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:47.775
No one. Just my friend Avery.

189
00:17:47.858 --> 00:17:52.659
Avery. Avery? Is that
a girl's name or a boy's name?

190
00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.123
Does it matter?

191
00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:57.543
No, no, it doesn't
matter unless it's a boy!

192
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.004
I know what makes you a boy.

193
00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:01.209
Uh, ooh,

194
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.082
You do?

195
00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:05.339
Your bald head.

196
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.008
Oh, yes.

197
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.172
It's really smooth.

198
00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:13.893
Sometimes I stare at it, and imagine
a little chick popping out.

199
00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:15.891
Peep peep peep.

200
00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:18.848
Good night, Agnes.

201
00:18:20.057 --> 00:18:22.059
Never get older.

202
00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:57.599
Hey, oh!

203
00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.063
Uh...

204
00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:02.400
Okay, okay.

205
00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:35.140
Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

206
00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:39.763
Donnie, hang in there, baby!
It's almost Friday.

207
00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.557
So, how's today's batch,
Dr. Nefario?

208
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.358
I developed a new formula

209
00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:46.276
which allowed me
to get every known

210
00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:49.196
kind of berry into
one flavor of jelly.

211
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.368
That tastes good!

212
00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:57.117
I love the flavor of that!

213
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.368
It's horrible, isn't it?

214
00:19:58.447 --> 00:19:59.790
No, no!

215
00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:02.828
Oh, we're making
great progress!

216
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.287
Here, try some of this.

217
00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:05.454
Mmm.

218
00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:09.625
Ah.

219
00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:16.720
Whoa.

220
00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:21.805
Okay, just because everybody hates
it, doesn't mean it's not good!

221
00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:23.723
Listen, Gru.

222
00:20:23.806 --> 00:20:25.399
There's something
I've been meaning

223
00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:27.192
to talk to you
about for some time now.

224
00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:29.103
What? What's wrong?

225
00:20:29.186 --> 00:20:30.438
Um...

226
00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:34.401
I miss being evil.

227
00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:38.659
Sinister plots, large-scale
crimes, it's what I live for.

228
00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:43.577
I mean, don't you think there's
more to our future than jelly?

229
00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:46.875
Well, I'm also
considering a line of jams.

230
00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:50.337
Um, the thing is, Gru,

231
00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:53.669
I've had an offer of
employment elsewhere.

232
00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:56.096
Dr. Nefario!

233
00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:58.220
Come on, you're kidding, right?

234
00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.388
It's a great
opportunity for me.

235
00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:03.262
Bigger lab, more evil,

236
00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.189
full dental.

237
00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:14.986
Very well.

238
00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:18.695
Let us give you
the proper send-off.

239
00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:20.405
Minions!

240
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:29.251
The highest honor
awarded to Dr. Nefario

241
00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:32.170
for your years of service,

242
00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:35.719
the 21-fart gun salute!

243
00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.060
Uh, I counted 22.

244
00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:55.239
Farewell, my friends.

245
00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:15.960
This may take a while.

246
00:22:16.502 --> 00:22:18.596
Go about your business.

247
00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:23.430
I miss you already!

248
00:23:04.967 --> 00:23:05.968
Huh?

249
00:23:10.014 --> 00:23:11.106
Huh.

250
00:23:18.522 --> 00:23:20.650
Are you sure we
should be doing this?

251
00:23:20.816 --> 00:23:22.818
Yes, it's for his own good.

252
00:23:22.985 --> 00:23:25.488
Okay,
we need to choose a picture.

253
00:23:25.613 --> 00:23:26.614
No.

254
00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:27.998
Scary.

255
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.241
Weird.

256
00:23:31.035 --> 00:23:32.207
What is that?

257
00:23:32.286 --> 00:23:35.005
Good morning, girls! I have
an announcement to make.

258
00:23:35.164 --> 00:23:37.041
Hey, what
celebrity do you look like?

259
00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:39.464
Uh, Bruce Willis.

260
00:23:40.002 --> 00:23:41.128
Mmm, no.

261
00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:42.880
Humpty Dumpty!

262
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.506
Ooh, Gollum!

263
00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:47.977
Okay, what are you doing?

264
00:23:48.052 --> 00:23:49.975
We're signing you
up for online dating!

265
00:23:50.054 --> 00:23:52.853
Oh, okay. What? No, no, no.

266
00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:54.816
Oh, come on. It's fun.

267
00:23:54.892 --> 00:23:56.769
And it's time for
you to get out there.

268
00:23:56.852 --> 00:24:00.072
No! Stop! No one is ever
getting out there! Ever!

269
00:24:00.189 --> 00:24:03.363
Oh! Okay, now for
the announcement.

270
00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:05.862
I have accepted a new job.

271
00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:07.197
Whoa! Really?

272
00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:10.783
Yes, I have been recruited
by a top-secret agency

273
00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:13.210
to go undercover
and save the world!

274
00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:14.628
You're gonna be a spy?

275
00:24:14.703 --> 00:24:16.580
That's right, baby!

276
00:24:16.705 --> 00:24:18.548
Gru's back in the game.

277
00:24:18.624 --> 00:24:22.345
With gadgets and weapons and cool cars.
The whole deal.

278
00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:23.545
Awesome!

279
00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:25.927
Are you really
gonna save the world?

280
00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:29.518
Yes. Yes, I am.

281
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.247
Ah!

282
00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:01.925
Hmm.

283
00:25:02.543 --> 00:25:04.386
"Bake My Day."

284
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:06.262
Blech.

285
00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:18.734
All right, here is the cupcake
recipe I got off the Internet.

286
00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:25.862
And don't go nuts
with the sprinkles!

287
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:48.468
Whoo.

288
00:25:48.589 --> 00:25:51.593
I wasn't expecting that.
Or was I?

289
00:25:52.593 --> 00:25:55.972
Ooh. You got a little...

290
00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.813
Here, I'll get it.

291
00:25:59.975 --> 00:26:01.227
Oh.

292
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.903
It's just spreading.

293
00:26:02.978 --> 00:26:05.322
All right, all right.
I got it! Stop it!

294
00:26:05.481 --> 00:26:06.824
Oh.

295
00:26:06.899 --> 00:26:07.946
I'll let you get it.

296
00:26:10.194 --> 00:26:11.867
Yeah, what you just
saw there was a little

297
00:26:11.945 --> 00:26:13.618
something new
I've been working on.

298
00:26:13.697 --> 00:26:17.622
It's a combination of Jujitsu,
Krav Maga, Aztec warfare

299
00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:19.874
and krumping.

300
00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:22.669
Okay, that's weird.
Why are you here?

301
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.418
On assignment from Silas.
I'm your new partner.

302
00:26:25.501 --> 00:26:26.753
Yay!

303
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.509
What? No, no "yay".

304
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:32.262
Ramsbottom didn't say anything
about a partner.

305
00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:34.264
Well, it seems that because
of your checkered past,

306
00:26:34.343 --> 00:26:36.095
everyone else
refused to work with you.

307
00:26:36.178 --> 00:26:38.556
But not me. I stepped up.

308
00:26:38.722 --> 00:26:42.192
And I'm new, so I kind of have
to do what they tell me anyway.

309
00:26:42.726 --> 00:26:43.898
Walla!

310
00:26:46.313 --> 00:26:47.360
Ya!

311
00:26:47.481 --> 00:26:48.824
Aah!

312
00:26:49.024 --> 00:26:50.321
Do you know this guy?

313
00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:52.490
Yes, he's one of my minions.

314
00:26:52.903 --> 00:26:54.405
Oh, I'm sorry.

315
00:26:54.905 --> 00:26:56.532
I should have known.

316
00:26:56.698 --> 00:26:58.371
You are free to go.

317
00:27:03.747 --> 00:27:06.751
Uh? Ah!

318
00:27:14.091 --> 00:27:15.138
<i>Kampai!</i>

319
00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:30.862
Oh!

320
00:27:30.941 --> 00:27:32.033
<i>Dave...</i>

321
00:27:33.402 --> 00:27:35.279
Earth to Dave!

322
00:27:35.404 --> 00:27:36.576
Huh?

323
00:27:36.697 --> 00:27:38.165
You can leave now.

324
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.287
Oh, uh...

325
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.134
So, what do we got?
Who's on the list?

326
00:27:49.293 --> 00:27:50.545
Fire them at me.

327
00:27:50.752 --> 00:27:53.676
First suspect,
Hedda Blumentoft,

328
00:27:53.755 --> 00:27:55.632
proprietor of Mum's
the Word Floral Shop.

329
00:27:55.716 --> 00:27:57.514
No, not her.

330
00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:59.223
Okay, moving on...

331
00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:02.143
Chuck Kinney,
owner of Stuff-A-Bear.

332
00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:05.313
Ooh.

333
00:28:05.475 --> 00:28:06.601
I don't think so.

334
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:08.566
Hello?

335
00:28:11.899 --> 00:28:14.448
<i>Buenos dias</i>, my friends!

336
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:17.238
I am Eduardo Perez,

337
00:28:17.404 --> 00:28:20.624
owner of <i>Salsa y Salsa</i>
restaurant, across the mall.

338
00:28:20.782 --> 00:28:23.752
Now open for breakfast.
And you are?

339
00:28:23.911 --> 00:28:26.630
Gru. And this is Lucy.
And we are closed.

340
00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:28.916
This is just going
to take <i>un momento</i>.

341
00:28:29.082 --> 00:28:31.460
I am throwing a big
<i>Cinco de Mayo</i> party,

342
00:28:31.627 --> 00:28:35.632
and I am going to need
200 of your best cupcakes

343
00:28:35.756 --> 00:28:39.556
decorated with
the Mexican flag.

344
00:28:39.635 --> 00:28:41.353
It looks something like this.

345
00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:44.348
What do you think?

346
00:28:44.514 --> 00:28:46.312
- Ooh.
- Oh.

347
00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:47.559
Look away!

348
00:28:47.643 --> 00:28:48.644
You, whoo.

349
00:28:49.937 --> 00:28:53.817
Anyway, I have to go. It's all settled.
I'll pick them up next week!

350
00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:57.828
Have a good day. Come by
if you get a chance, okay?

351
00:29:01.031 --> 00:29:04.581
And welcome to the mall family.

352
00:29:12.167 --> 00:29:13.635
El Macho.

353
00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:15.087
What?

354
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.342
But it couldn't be.

355
00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:18.010
What? What couldn't be?

356
00:29:19.174 --> 00:29:24.556
That guy looks exactly like
a villain named El Macho.

357
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.523
From about 20 years ago.

358
00:29:32.562 --> 00:29:34.030
<i>He was ruthless!</i>

359
00:29:34.189 --> 00:29:35.691
<i>He was dangerous.</i>

360
00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:39.703
<i>And as the name implies,
very macho.</i>

361
00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:55.044
<i>He had a reputation for pulling off
heists using only his bare hands!</i>

362
00:29:57.087 --> 00:30:02.184
<i>But sadly, like all the greats,
El Macho was gone too soon.</i>

363
00:30:02.843 --> 00:30:05.562
<i>He died in the most
macho way possible.</i>

364
00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:07.389
<i>Riding a shark</i>

365
00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:11.648
<i>with 250 pounds of dynamite
strapped to his chest</i>

366
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:15.906
<i>into the mouth of
an active volcano!</i>

367
00:30:18.442 --> 00:30:19.989
<i>It was glorious.</i>

368
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:25.245
Yeah, sounds like
El Macho's pretty dead.

369
00:30:25.365 --> 00:30:27.788
They never found the body.
Oh, no.

370
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:33.086
All that was ever retrieved was
a pile of singed chest hair.

371
00:30:33.248 --> 00:30:36.798
But that face!
It has got to be El Macho!

372
00:30:37.377 --> 00:30:41.257
Then what do you say you and I
break into his restaurant? Tonight?

373
00:30:41.423 --> 00:30:44.051
Yes, that's good,
because I am telling you,

374
00:30:44.134 --> 00:30:48.389
if anybody in this
place has the PX-41 serum,

375
00:30:49.014 --> 00:30:50.641
it's him.

376
00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:56.859
All right, all right, homework done,
pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed.

377
00:30:56.938 --> 00:30:58.110
What's the big hurry?

378
00:30:58.273 --> 00:31:00.150
I just have
a lot of work to do.

379
00:31:00.275 --> 00:31:02.198
Work, what kind of work?

380
00:31:02.277 --> 00:31:03.995
Very important business.

381
00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:05.869
So, hugs, kisses.

382
00:31:05.947 --> 00:31:08.791
Good night, sleep tight, don't
let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah.

383
00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:09.914
Whoa!

384
00:31:09.993 --> 00:31:11.370
But you said
you'd help me practice

385
00:31:11.453 --> 00:31:13.547
my part for
the Mother's Day show.

386
00:31:15.123 --> 00:31:18.218
Fine, fine.
Let me hear it. Quickly.

387
00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:22.098
<i>She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair.</i>

388
00:31:22.297 --> 00:31:25.176
<i>My mother is beyond compare.</i>

389
00:31:25.342 --> 00:31:28.221
<i>We love you,
mothers, everywhere.</i>

390
00:31:28.804 --> 00:31:31.648
Wow! That was something else.

391
00:31:31.807 --> 00:31:34.777
I really liked the way
you smiled at the end.

392
00:31:34.935 --> 00:31:36.937
Let's try this one more time,

393
00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:42.201
but a teensy bit less
like a zombie, okay?

394
00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:43.322
Okay.

395
00:31:43.402 --> 00:31:46.451
<i>She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair...</i>

396
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.328
Perfect! Time to go.

397
00:31:48.407 --> 00:31:50.956
I don't think I
should do this.

398
00:31:51.034 --> 00:31:53.332
Well, what do you mean?
Why not?

399
00:31:53.412 --> 00:31:55.130
I don't even have a mom.

400
00:31:55.997 --> 00:31:58.591
Well, you don't need
one to do the show.

401
00:31:58.667 --> 00:32:01.420
I mean, you did
the Veterans Day Pageant

402
00:32:01.503 --> 00:32:03.005
and you haven't been in combat.

403
00:32:04.089 --> 00:32:05.511
This is different.

404
00:32:05.674 --> 00:32:10.646
Okay, well, then maybe you can
just use your imagination.

405
00:32:10.804 --> 00:32:13.603
You mean I
pretend I have a mom?

406
00:32:13.723 --> 00:32:16.476
Yes, right?
You can do that, can't you?

407
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.688
Yeah! I do that all the time.

408
00:32:18.812 --> 00:32:20.189
Thanks, Gru!

409
00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:25.952
Hey!

410
00:32:51.845 --> 00:32:54.064
All right. Hey, hey,
no, no! No.

411
00:32:54.181 --> 00:32:56.309
Hey. Hey, please.

412
00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:59.565
Kevin, Jerry,
watch the girls for me, okay?

413
00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:03.065
Dave, Stuart, come this way!
With me! Come on!

414
00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:06.993
Come on!

415
00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:08.069
Mmm-mmm!

416
00:33:38.183 --> 00:33:39.480
Oh!

417
00:33:41.937 --> 00:33:42.984
Mmm-hmm.

418
00:33:46.733 --> 00:33:47.780
Huh?

419
00:33:53.573 --> 00:33:55.621
Oca! Oca!

420
00:34:12.509 --> 00:34:13.556
Looka too!

421
00:34:18.848 --> 00:34:19.895
Huh?

422
00:34:59.806 --> 00:35:03.310
We're stealth ninjas.
We make no sound.

423
00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:05.612
Right. Gotcha.

424
00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:08.398
Ya!

425
00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:13.036
All right, El Macho.
You're going down.

426
00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:15.159
Wait! Wait.
What?

427
00:35:16.323 --> 00:35:17.916
What are you doing?

428
00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:20.619
I'm checking for
laser beam alarm triggers.

429
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:23.122
It's a restaurant!

430
00:35:23.246 --> 00:35:24.748
You never know what
kind of booby traps

431
00:35:24.873 --> 00:35:26.420
this guy could have set.
Huh? Come on.

432
00:35:26.499 --> 00:35:28.843
There are no booby traps.

433
00:35:30.211 --> 00:35:31.929
Ha! Booby!

434
00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:44.567
Oh. There's a chicken.

435
00:35:44.893 --> 00:35:46.941
Are you lost,
little guy?

436
00:35:47.062 --> 00:35:48.985
You must be lost.

437
00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:50.948
Ha! Some guard dog.

438
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:57.743
Get it off of me!
Get it off of me!

439
00:35:58.573 --> 00:35:59.574
Aah!

440
00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:07.003
I got you!

441
00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.263
I got it!

442
00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.223
Ha!

443
00:36:25.058 --> 00:36:26.059
om

444
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.989
What is wrong
with that chicken?

445
00:36:35.652 --> 00:36:39.623
Hey, that <i>pollo es loco</i>.

446
00:36:40.115 --> 00:36:41.287
No?

447
00:36:41.408 --> 00:36:43.331
Okay, let's go.

448
00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:52.009
Are you getting anything?

449
00:36:52.085 --> 00:36:53.632
No, not yet.

450
00:36:53.712 --> 00:36:57.512
But, hey, maybe you can find
something with these X-ray goggles.

451
00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:00.514
Bah.

452
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:07.643
How are they working?
Tell me! Tell me!

453
00:37:07.726 --> 00:37:09.103
Aah! Oof!

454
00:37:09.185 --> 00:37:10.778
What's wrong?
Is something wrong?

455
00:37:10.854 --> 00:37:14.233
That's an image I'll never
get out of my brain. Blech!

456
00:37:22.323 --> 00:37:24.166
I knew it!

457
00:37:24.325 --> 00:37:26.168
The serum is in here!

458
00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:27.496
Ooh, then let's get it.

459
00:37:29.497 --> 00:37:32.000
This is going to be good!

460
00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:33.130
Ah.

461
00:37:37.046 --> 00:37:38.639
Ah-ha!

462
00:37:38.715 --> 00:37:39.967
What?

463
00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:43.186
Salsa?

464
00:37:43.344 --> 00:37:44.937
Aw, man.

465
00:37:46.556 --> 00:37:47.557
Oh.

466
00:37:50.727 --> 00:37:54.573
Somebody's going
to die tonight.

467
00:38:00.028 --> 00:38:01.826
Pollito!

468
00:38:01.905 --> 00:38:04.328
What did they do to you?
Pollito? Can you hear me?

469
00:38:05.575 --> 00:38:08.954
Who would do this to such
a sweet little chicken?

470
00:38:09.037 --> 00:38:10.960
What? Who's there?

471
00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:12.666
Mmm-mmm.

472
00:38:12.749 --> 00:38:14.717
You coming out?
Or am I gonna go in?

473
00:38:19.881 --> 00:38:21.303
Yah!

474
00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:23.472
Huh?

475
00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:25.888
Stop!

476
00:38:26.012 --> 00:38:28.060
My eyes!

477
00:38:29.474 --> 00:38:31.397
Gru, call one of
your munchkins!

478
00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.687
We've been spotted!
Come get us!

479
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.147
Huh? Hey!

480
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.732
Ah!

481
00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:48.243
Hmm, subtle.

482
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.299
Over here! Over here!

483
00:38:54.415 --> 00:38:55.962
Over

484
00:38:56.042 --> 00:38:57.168
here.

485
00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:05.260
Hold tight!

486
00:39:09.097 --> 00:39:10.269
Aah!

487
00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:18.607
I have you now!

488
00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.477
Yay! Ice cream!

489
00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.067
Huh?

490
00:40:16.372 --> 00:40:18.420
Huh?

491
00:40:53.201 --> 00:40:54.748
All right, there he is.

492
00:40:54.911 --> 00:40:57.790
Suspect number eight,
Floyd Eaglesan.

493
00:40:57.956 --> 00:40:59.503
Oh, okay.

494
00:40:59.666 --> 00:41:01.543
See if you can get closer.
Go, go.

495
00:41:12.637 --> 00:41:14.105
All right.

496
00:41:14.222 --> 00:41:15.348
What the...

497
00:41:16.683 --> 00:41:18.685
Oh, no. That's not good.

498
00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.521
Whoa!

499
00:41:21.604 --> 00:41:23.072
Hey, uh, what?

500
00:41:25.024 --> 00:41:26.071
Oh!

501
00:41:30.405 --> 00:41:31.998
Hey, Gru!

502
00:41:32.073 --> 00:41:34.542
Oh, girls! What are you
doing here?

503
00:41:34.617 --> 00:41:36.585
Well, we thought
we'd come visit you at work.

504
00:41:36.744 --> 00:41:39.418
So, you're saving the world
in a garbage can?

505
00:41:40.957 --> 00:41:42.004
Funny.

506
00:41:42.083 --> 00:41:43.926
Hey! There you are.

507
00:41:44.043 --> 00:41:45.420
Oh. Who's this?

508
00:41:45.586 --> 00:41:49.591
Lucy, these are my girls,
Margo, Edith and Agnes.

509
00:41:49.716 --> 00:41:52.560
Girls, Lucy. Lucy, girls.

510
00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:54.603
Hello.
Hi.

511
00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:04.405
Are you single?

512
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.612
Oh! Goodness.

513
00:42:06.691 --> 00:42:10.741
Oh, hey! I have an idea. Since Lucy
and I have lots of work to do,

514
00:42:10.862 --> 00:42:13.490
why don't you girls go and
explore the mall? Bye!

515
00:42:13.698 --> 00:42:16.793
Here is some money, go buy
some useless mall junk.

516
00:42:16.951 --> 00:42:18.544
Some headbands and...

517
00:42:18.661 --> 00:42:20.129
Are you gonna marry Lucy?

518
00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:24.168
Are you out of your gourd?
No! She just works with me.

519
00:42:24.292 --> 00:42:25.669
Plus, you love her.

520
00:42:25.752 --> 00:42:28.471
<i>You love her! You love her!
You really, really love her!</i>

521
00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:29.801
<i>And you're gonna get married!</i>

522
00:42:29.881 --> 00:42:30.973
Okay, stop.
This is a song of lies.

523
00:42:31.049 --> 00:42:32.141
<i>And I will be the flower girl!</i>

524
00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:34.264
I don't even like her.
Now, go have fun!

525
00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.348
Almost forgot. Hugs!

526
00:42:38.431 --> 00:42:39.933
Good luck saving the world.
Bye.

527
00:42:40.016 --> 00:42:41.313
Bye, Gru!

528
00:42:45.646 --> 00:42:48.946
Kids, right? They're funny.

529
00:42:49.025 --> 00:42:50.993
Those girls totally
adore you.

530
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:52.821
I bet you're a fun dad.

531
00:42:53.488 --> 00:42:54.580
Huh.

532
00:42:54.655 --> 00:42:56.657
I am pretty fun.

533
00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:07.002
Is that stealing?

534
00:43:07.126 --> 00:43:10.005
Not if my wish was that I would
get a lot of free coins.

535
00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:39.292
Whoa!

536
00:43:41.202 --> 00:43:42.704
Cool glasses.

537
00:43:42.912 --> 00:43:43.959
Oh.

538
00:43:44.664 --> 00:43:46.132
I'm Antonio.

539
00:43:46.374 --> 00:43:48.217
I'm Margo.

540
00:43:48.376 --> 00:43:51.971
I was just going to get a cookie.
Care to join me?

541
00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:54.014
Uh, sure.

542
00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:56.809
I'm Margo.

543
00:44:04.767 --> 00:44:06.986
Um, I'll catch up
with you guys later.

544
00:44:07.061 --> 00:44:08.404
Bye!

545
00:44:10.148 --> 00:44:12.526
Can I be
the first to say, "Ew!"

546
00:44:12.608 --> 00:44:14.485
We gotta go tell Gru!

547
00:44:19.198 --> 00:44:20.791
All right, I'm going in.

548
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:23.920
<i>If it picks up any traces of the
serum, the sensor in your belt buckle</i>

549
00:44:23.995 --> 00:44:25.372
will make a sound like this...

550
00:44:25.454 --> 00:44:26.706
Mee-maw! Mee-maw!

551
00:44:26.831 --> 00:44:27.832
<i>Mee-maw! Mee-maw!</i>
Okay!

552
00:44:27.915 --> 00:44:29.667
I get it. I get it.

553
00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:39.974
Welcome to Eagle Hair Club.

554
00:44:40.094 --> 00:44:42.643
It's about time you showed up,

555
00:44:42.805 --> 00:44:44.102
Mr. Gru.

556
00:44:45.433 --> 00:44:47.356
You know my name?

557
00:44:48.603 --> 00:44:51.948
When someone moves into the mall
who is folically-challenged,

558
00:44:52.064 --> 00:44:55.614
I make it my business
to know all about them.

559
00:44:55.776 --> 00:44:58.450
You are bald, and that is bad.

560
00:44:59.655 --> 00:45:01.282
There you go, my sweet.

561
00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:03.242
<i>I'm getting nothing so far.</i>

562
00:45:03.326 --> 00:45:04.953
I think you need
to move around.

563
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:15.429
Wow, this looks interesting.
What is it?

564
00:45:15.588 --> 00:45:17.090
I take it you're an art lover?

565
00:45:17.256 --> 00:45:18.303
<i>No serum.</i>

566
00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:19.599
Yeah, not so much.

567
00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:26.357
Oh, how about this
impressive trinket?

568
00:45:26.474 --> 00:45:28.272
I'd hardly call it
a trinket, Mr. Gru.

569
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:29.853
<i>Nothing.</i>
The International...

570
00:45:29.936 --> 00:45:31.062
Yeah, I don't care.

571
00:45:37.235 --> 00:45:38.236
<i>Mee-maw! Mee-maw!</i>

572
00:45:38.319 --> 00:45:40.742
<i>Hold on, I'm picking up something.
Behind that wall!</i>

573
00:45:40.821 --> 00:45:42.494
Ah, and what do we have here?

574
00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:45.827
These are my trial wigs.
You should take one.

575
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:49.164
No, thanks. So, what's on
the other side of the wall?

576
00:45:49.288 --> 00:45:50.585
Here you are!
Look at me! Focus!

577
00:45:50.665 --> 00:45:51.837
Gru?

578
00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:56.422
I promise that this wig will
transform you from ugly

579
00:45:56.504 --> 00:45:59.599
to irresistible.

580
00:46:00.216 --> 00:46:01.843
Margo has a boyfriend!

581
00:46:01.926 --> 00:46:03.928
And they're going on a date!

582
00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:05.354
Date? Boyfriend?

583
00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:06.681
What?

584
00:46:19.068 --> 00:46:20.194
There she goes!

585
00:46:32.164 --> 00:46:33.882
Oh, you're so funny.

586
00:46:34.041 --> 00:46:35.133
Gross!

587
00:46:35.334 --> 00:46:37.382
Look, they're in love.
Oh, no, no, no.

588
00:46:37.503 --> 00:46:39.881
Do not say that. No, no, no.

589
00:46:39.964 --> 00:46:44.310
And my dream is to one day
play video games for a living.

590
00:46:44.385 --> 00:46:46.137
Wow.

591
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.268
You're so complicated.

592
00:46:48.389 --> 00:46:49.936
Margo.

593
00:46:50.057 --> 00:46:51.604
What is going on here?

594
00:46:52.184 --> 00:46:56.485
Oh, Gru, <i>se llama</i> Antonio.
<i>Me llamo</i> Margo.

595
00:46:56.564 --> 00:46:59.909
Me llama-lama ding-dong.
Who cares? Let's go.

596
00:47:05.865 --> 00:47:06.912
Whoa!

597
00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:32.399
Kids eat free on Tuesdays.

598
00:47:42.443 --> 00:47:43.865
Yay, Pop!

599
00:47:43.944 --> 00:47:45.571
That's awesome!

600
00:47:47.448 --> 00:47:51.123
So good to see you again, <i>mi compadre</i>!
Ha! Yeah.

601
00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:53.671
Oh, I see you have
already met my father.

602
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:55.923
What? Father?

603
00:47:55.998 --> 00:47:59.423
Si. Look at this crazy
small world we live in, eh?

604
00:47:59.502 --> 00:48:01.504
Come, sit,
let me get you something.

605
00:48:03.255 --> 00:48:05.349
Oh, look at you. Heh?

606
00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:09.728
He likes me.

607
00:48:09.804 --> 00:48:13.684
Oh, oh! I'm sorry. Pollito
is usually very friendly.

608
00:48:13.766 --> 00:48:15.359
He had a rough night.

609
00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:21.615
Well, we really should be going.
Girls, come on.

610
00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:23.484
That is a pity.

611
00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:26.286
Young love is beautiful, no?

612
00:48:26.404 --> 00:48:27.656
No!

613
00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:31.333
You know, they're not in love.
They hardly know each other.

614
00:48:32.159 --> 00:48:34.332
You are right, <i>Cabeza de huevo</i>.

615
00:48:34.412 --> 00:48:36.665
They must get to
know each other better!

616
00:48:36.831 --> 00:48:40.881
Antonio, why don't you invite
your girlfriend and her family

617
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.587
to our <i>Cinco de Mayo</i> party?

618
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:43.717
No, no.

619
00:48:43.838 --> 00:48:44.930
Si!

620
00:48:59.728 --> 00:49:02.026
I'm sorry, El Macho?

621
00:49:02.106 --> 00:49:04.154
Hadn't we
eliminated him as a suspect

622
00:49:04.275 --> 00:49:06.277
after the whole
salsa incident?

623
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.863
Yes, but there has
been a new development,

624
00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:12.041
and I'm telling you,
this is the guy.

625
00:49:12.116 --> 00:49:14.539
You need to
arrest him immediately.

626
00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:18.122
And his deviously charming son!

627
00:49:18.205 --> 00:49:21.129
I'm pretty sure that
the son is involved, too.

628
00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:23.882
The son, also!
You got to get the son!

629
00:49:24.003 --> 00:49:27.553
I think that
the son is the mastermind!

630
00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:30.180
There's a look,
there's a devilish look

631
00:49:30.259 --> 00:49:31.806
in his eyes,
and I don't like it!

632
00:49:31.886 --> 00:49:33.980
Yes, but I don't
really see any evidence.

633
00:49:34.096 --> 00:49:35.814
Evidence, schmevidence.
I go with my gut,

634
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:39.565
and my gut tells me
that this guy is El Macho.

635
00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:42.146
Lock him up, lock up the son.

636
00:49:42.229 --> 00:49:46.234
Don't forget about the son.
The kid gives me the creeps!

637
00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.323
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

638
00:49:48.402 --> 00:49:53.408
But, on the less
crazy side of things,

639
00:49:53.574 --> 00:49:56.703
Gru discovered traces of the
serum at Eagle Hair Club!

640
00:49:57.369 --> 00:49:59.042
Hmm, interesting.

641
00:49:59.121 --> 00:50:01.340
Yeah! And you know
who made that happen? Huh?

642
00:50:01.415 --> 00:50:04.715
This guy.
Nailed it. Amazing, right?

643
00:50:04.793 --> 00:50:08.593
No, I mean, sure. But it's
not him, it is El Macho!

644
00:50:08.714 --> 00:50:10.591
Mr. Gru, please!

645
00:50:10.758 --> 00:50:13.602
No! It is him,
and I will prove it!

646
00:50:15.095 --> 00:50:17.268
Gru, come on!

647
00:50:19.892 --> 00:50:22.065
He really
thinks it's El Macho.

648
00:50:22.937 --> 00:50:24.280
Can you tell?

649
00:50:48.796 --> 00:50:50.423
Oh. Whoo!

650
00:51:27.543 --> 00:51:28.840
Give me that!

651
00:51:37.011 --> 00:51:39.890
Kevin, the Wi-Fi's out!

652
00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.773
Kevin?

653
00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:44.526
Hey, Lance,
where the heck is Kevin?

654
00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:50.195
All right, we need to revisit the
number of vacation days you guys get.

655
00:51:50.274 --> 00:51:52.652
I can't find anybody anymore.

656
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.454
Gru, it's Jillian!

657
00:51:56.447 --> 00:51:58.370
I've got good news!

658
00:51:58.532 --> 00:52:00.660
I have my friend
Shannon here with me.

659
00:52:00.743 --> 00:52:02.871
I was thinking you
two could get some grub.

660
00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:06.378
You know, tear it up, see what happens!

661
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.541
Open up!

662
00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:09.172
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la, la...</i>

663
00:52:09.251 --> 00:52:12.175
Agnes! Agnes,
tell Jillian I'm not here.

664
00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:14.385
Gru's not here.

665
00:52:14.548 --> 00:52:16.221
Are you sure?

666
00:52:16.342 --> 00:52:17.810
Yes, he just told me!

667
00:52:17.885 --> 00:52:19.933
Mmm-mmm!

668
00:52:20.429 --> 00:52:22.477
I mean,
no, he didn't just tell me.

669
00:52:22.598 --> 00:52:25.693
Agnes, where is Gru?

670
00:52:27.061 --> 00:52:28.938
He's putting on lipstick!

671
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:31.903
He's swatting at flies!

672
00:52:32.024 --> 00:52:33.071
No! No!

673
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:34.652
He's chopping his head off!

674
00:52:36.737 --> 00:52:39.115
He's pooping?

675
00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:41.917
I know you're in there, Gru!

676
00:52:42.076 --> 00:52:45.455
There's no way you're
getting out of this!

677
00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:54.047
I have to tell you, I
was so nervous about tonight.

678
00:52:54.129 --> 00:52:57.349
I mean there's just so
many phonies out there!

679
00:52:58.008 --> 00:53:00.852
Yes, I hear you.

680
00:53:01.679 --> 00:53:03.397
Oh, so, do you work out?

681
00:53:03.472 --> 00:53:04.564
Well...

682
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.519
I mean, obviously, you
don't, but would you consider it?

683
00:53:07.643 --> 00:53:11.273
Huh? Physical fitness is
very important to Shannon.

684
00:53:11.355 --> 00:53:13.153
As you can tell,
right? Huh?

685
00:53:14.316 --> 00:53:15.408
Ah.

686
00:53:15.484 --> 00:53:16.610
I can tell.

687
00:53:16.735 --> 00:53:17.861
Solid.

688
00:53:17.945 --> 00:53:20.539
We are in the restaurant,
you know.

689
00:53:22.449 --> 00:53:23.951
Hi. Takeout for Lucy?

690
00:53:24.076 --> 00:53:25.578
Sure, just a sec.

691
00:53:37.548 --> 00:53:40.848
<i>Your accent is so exotic.</i>

692
00:53:40.926 --> 00:53:43.145
Ah. Well, thank you very much.

693
00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.893
I know someone who
can fix that for you.

694
00:53:44.972 --> 00:53:47.816
And you'll be
talking normal in no time!

695
00:53:50.144 --> 00:53:52.317
Whoo. Is it hot in here?

696
00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:56.029
How's the food?

697
00:53:57.067 --> 00:54:00.788
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Are you wearing a wig?

698
00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:02.030
What?

699
00:54:02.114 --> 00:54:04.082
Ah! I don't think so.

700
00:54:04.158 --> 00:54:05.330
I knew it.

701
00:54:05.451 --> 00:54:07.579
You're a phony.
I hate phonies!

702
00:54:07.661 --> 00:54:09.880
Oh, what?
No. These locks are all mine.

703
00:54:09.955 --> 00:54:11.252
No, they're not!

704
00:54:11.331 --> 00:54:14.460
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm
gonna rip that thing off your head,

705
00:54:14.543 --> 00:54:17.422
and show everyone what a
bald-headed phony you are.

706
00:54:17.504 --> 00:54:18.721
I don't think so, Miss Lady.

707
00:54:28.474 --> 00:54:29.726
Hello?

708
00:54:29.808 --> 00:54:31.151
Hello? Are you...

709
00:54:31.226 --> 00:54:32.478
Hey, Gru.

710
00:54:32.561 --> 00:54:35.690
Hello, Lucy.
How are you doing?

711
00:54:35.773 --> 00:54:38.196
Wow, looks like your
date's out for the count.

712
00:54:38.275 --> 00:54:41.279
It's like she's been shot with
a mild moose tranquilizer.

713
00:54:47.159 --> 00:54:50.003
Yeah, I'm winking because
that's what actually happened.

714
00:54:50.078 --> 00:54:53.298
<i>Scusi</i>, what's happening here?
She no like?

715
00:54:53.373 --> 00:54:54.841
Oh, she's just, uh...

716
00:54:56.335 --> 00:54:57.461
Oh, ho.

717
00:54:57.544 --> 00:54:59.512
<i>Si, si. Si.</i>

718
00:54:59.588 --> 00:55:01.010
Shall we take her home?

719
00:55:12.059 --> 00:55:13.231
Oh!

720
00:55:43.465 --> 00:55:46.935
Well, I think you did it. You just
officially had the worst date ever.

721
00:55:47.052 --> 00:55:48.599
Huh, tell me about it.

722
00:55:48.971 --> 00:55:52.191
Don't worry. It can only get
better from here, right?

723
00:55:52.266 --> 00:55:54.394
But if it doesn't, you can
always borrow my dart gun.

724
00:55:54.476 --> 00:55:56.854
I've had to use it on
one or two dates myself.

725
00:55:56.979 --> 00:55:59.198
Yeah, you know,
as far as dates go,

726
00:55:59.273 --> 00:56:01.617
I think I'm good
with just the one.

727
00:56:05.487 --> 00:56:08.491
Well, good night, partner.

728
00:56:10.826 --> 00:56:12.078
This was fun.

729
00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:15.004
Yes. Surprisingly, it was.

730
00:56:15.497 --> 00:56:17.966
Oh, and, uh,
just between you and me?

731
00:56:18.542 --> 00:56:20.419
You look much better bald.

732
00:56:22.838 --> 00:56:24.306
See you tomorrow.

733
00:56:33.473 --> 00:56:35.066
Quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack!

734
00:56:40.564 --> 00:56:41.781
Yay!

735
00:56:41.857 --> 00:56:43.484
So, I take it
the date went well?

736
00:56:43.567 --> 00:56:45.820
No, it was horrible.

737
00:56:56.622 --> 00:56:59.000
High-five!

738
00:56:59.917 --> 00:57:01.214
Bump it.

739
00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:45.258
Mr. Ramsbottom?

740
00:57:45.379 --> 00:57:46.596
Oh, hello.

741
00:57:46.713 --> 00:57:48.135
What are you doing here?

742
00:57:48.215 --> 00:57:50.138
We got him.
Got who?

743
00:57:50.258 --> 00:57:51.931
Floyd Eaglesan!

744
00:57:52.052 --> 00:57:54.976
Our agents located a secret
room in his shop last night

745
00:57:55.055 --> 00:57:56.853
and discovered this.

746
00:57:56.932 --> 00:58:01.062
It's empty, but we found traces
of the PX-41 serum in it.

747
00:58:01.228 --> 00:58:02.571
He's our man.

748
00:58:02.688 --> 00:58:07.068
So, somehow, in spite of your
incompetence, we solved this one.

749
00:58:07.192 --> 00:58:08.739
I was framed!

750
00:58:08.819 --> 00:58:10.412
You won't get away with this!

751
00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:13.036
Get your mitts off of me!
I am a legitimate businessman.

752
00:58:13.115 --> 00:58:16.870
Ah. All right. So what now?

753
00:58:16.952 --> 00:58:20.047
Well, now you're free to
go back to your business.

754
00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:22.586
Mmm. Jams and jellies.

755
00:58:22.708 --> 00:58:24.676
And it looks like
Agent Wilde will be

756
00:58:24.751 --> 00:58:26.719
transferring to our
Australian branch.

757
00:58:27.421 --> 00:58:28.638
Australia?

758
00:58:28.714 --> 00:58:29.931
Yes.

759
00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:31.763
But thank you for everything.

760
00:58:31.842 --> 00:58:34.686
And by everything,
of course I mean nothing.

761
00:58:34.761 --> 00:58:37.355
Toodle pip and cheerio,
Mr. Gru.

762
00:58:41.852 --> 00:58:44.071
Hey, there.
Hey.

763
00:58:44.146 --> 00:58:45.568
So, we got him.

764
00:58:45.647 --> 00:58:48.776
Yay. That's great.

765
00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.698
And now you're
going to Australia?

766
00:58:50.777 --> 00:58:53.530
Well, it's not definite yet.
I'm still figuring it out.

767
00:58:53.613 --> 00:58:55.741
I've already been
working on my accent.

768
00:58:55.824 --> 00:58:57.997
Wallaby. Didgeridoo.

769
00:58:58.118 --> 00:59:00.792
Hugh Jackman.

770
00:59:01.163 --> 00:59:04.758
So, um... Pretty excited.

771
00:59:05.625 --> 00:59:07.093
Great.

772
00:59:07.169 --> 00:59:09.467
Well, good luck.

773
00:59:09.588 --> 00:59:12.341
Thanks. You, too.

774
00:59:13.133 --> 00:59:15.807
Oh! Here.
I wanted to give you this.

775
00:59:15.969 --> 00:59:17.812
Your lipstick taser?

776
00:59:17.888 --> 00:59:19.811
Yeah, it's just a memento.

777
00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:23.986
Just, you know,
from the first time we met.

778
00:59:24.144 --> 00:59:26.317
Oh. Thank you, Lucy.

779
00:59:27.147 --> 00:59:28.649
Agent Wilde.

780
00:59:29.107 --> 00:59:32.236
Well, it looks like
they need you, so...

781
00:59:32.319 --> 00:59:35.118
Yeah, I better go.

782
00:59:36.198 --> 00:59:37.575
Bye, Gru.

783
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:16.037
I brought you an umbrella.

784
01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:21.000
Ah, thank you.

785
01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.669
What are you
doing out here?

786
01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:27.375
Remember when you
said that I liked Lucy?

787
01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:31.007
Well, it turns out,

788
01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:32.386
you're right.

789
01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.222
Really?

790
01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:35.758
Yes, but...

791
01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:38.890
Well, she's moving away.

792
01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.768
I'm never going
to see her again.

793
01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:47.611
Is there anything
I could do to help?

794
01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:51.941
Aw, I don't... I don't
think so, sweetheart.

795
01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:55.573
Well, is there
anything you could do?

796
01:00:57.195 --> 01:00:59.823
Hello, Lucy. This is Gru.

797
01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:03.001
I know up to this
point our relationship

798
01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:05.420
has been strictly professional,

799
01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:09.796
and you're leaving for
Australia and all, but...

800
01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:13.007
Okay, here is the question.

801
01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.763
Would you like to...

802
01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:19.431
To go out on a date?

803
01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.933
Uh, no.

804
01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:23.976
Okay, that's not helping.

805
01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:27.067
All right, here we go.
For real this time.

806
01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:38.328
I can do this.

807
01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:58.299
Agh! I hate you!

808
01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:03.182
Ah.

809
01:02:58.525 --> 01:02:59.572
Eh.

810
01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.407
Kevin?
Mmm?

811
01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:03.781
Tom?

812
01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:04.955
Hello!

813
01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:07.284
<i>Kampai! Kampai!</i>

814
01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:08.584
Huh? <i>Kampai!</i>

815
01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:21.594
Bah!

816
01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:27.012
Oh.

817
01:03:29.014 --> 01:03:32.234
<i>Cinco de May-ya-yo!
Cinco de May-ya-yo!</i>

818
01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:42.193
Whoa!

819
01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:44.447
This place is awesome!

820
01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.038
Okay. Let's party, huh?

821
01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:51.836
But first,
let's go over the rules.

822
01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:55.165
Because what is fun
without the rules?

823
01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:56.959
Agnes, easy on the churros.

824
01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.378
Edith, try not to kill anyone.
<i>Hai!</i>

825
01:03:59.627 --> 01:04:00.674
Margo!

826
01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:01.880
Hello, Mr. Gru.

827
01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:03.340
Okay.

828
01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:04.970
Gru!

829
01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:10.018
There must be the standard 6 feet
of space between you and boys.

830
01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:11.890
Especially this boy.

831
01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:14.977
Ah, you are a funny man.

832
01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:17.942
There are no rules, <i>seÒor</i>.
It's <i>Cinco de Mayo.</i>.

833
01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:20.323
Come on!
They're starting the dance!

834
01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.942
<i>Arriba!</i>

835
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:23.512
So glad you could
make it, <i>mi compadre</i>.

836
01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:25.422
Hey, what's wrong?

837
01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:27.507
Oh, nothing.
Nothing is wrong.

838
01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:32.354
I'm just chilling with the
guac, from my chip hat.

839
01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:38.648
Gru, please. I know
that look all too well.

840
01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:41.149
It is the look
of a broken heart.

841
01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:42.572
How did you know?

842
01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:46.159
Believe me, my friend,
I too have spent many nights

843
01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:49.909
trying to drown my
sorrows in guacamole.

844
01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:52.332
You?
Yes.

845
01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:56.161
But we are survivors.

846
01:05:56.244 --> 01:06:00.374
There's much more to
us than meets the eye.

847
01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:02.922
Enjoy the party.

848
01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:57.597
Huh.

849
01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.711
Ah-ha!

850
01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:25.083
Ouch!

851
01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:43.313
Say what?

852
01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:59.160
Would you like some
peanuts or pretzels?

853
01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:05.748
That's a good joke.

854
01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:12.175
I just did a boom boom.

855
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.968
I really need you to
make a choice, hon.

856
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:19.012
I choose Gru.

857
01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:21.852
I choose Gru!

858
01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.608
Thank you, Gru stewardess!

859
01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:29.360
You're welcome!

860
01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:48.712
Aah!

861
01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:06.394
You have not lost
your touch, my friend.

862
01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:08.774
Ah-ha! I knew it!

863
01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:10.442
You are El Macho!

864
01:09:10.605 --> 01:09:12.824
That's right!

865
01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:14.572
Nobody believed me!

866
01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:16.494
Ho-ho! But I knew
you weren't dead!

867
01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:21.412
Of course not.
I merely faked my death.

868
01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.373
But now, it's time for me

869
01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:28.423
to make
a spectacular return to evil.

870
01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:34.338
Doctor, I think it's time we
showed Gru what we're up to here.

871
01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.468
Dr. Nefario?

872
01:09:36.547 --> 01:09:38.720
Nice to see you, Gru.

873
01:09:39.384 --> 01:09:40.431
Wha...?

874
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:43.514
So, this is your
new job opportunity?

875
01:09:43.596 --> 01:09:46.566
Absolutely.
You're gonna like this.

876
01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:52.730
Sorry.

877
01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:56.610
I had to borrow some of your minions,
but it was for a worthy cause.

878
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.704
Oh! Kevin!

879
01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:02.282
No, he's not Kevin anymore.

880
01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:07.375
Now he is an indestructible,
mindless killing machine!

881
01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:08.454
Bah!

882
01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:10.544
Just watch this.

883
01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:25.184
Bah!

884
01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:27.140
And here's the best part!

885
01:10:27.265 --> 01:10:30.485
I got an army of them!

886
01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:34.647
Look, look, look!

887
01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:42.822
Bah!

888
01:10:42.947 --> 01:10:47.077
Soon I will unleash
them on the world,

889
01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:51.297
and if anyone,
anyone tries to stop them...

890
01:10:51.372 --> 01:10:52.498
Yeow!

891
01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:55.176
...their city gets eaten!

892
01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:57.212
We can do it together.

893
01:10:57.336 --> 01:10:58.508
Together?

894
01:10:58.629 --> 01:10:59.676
Together!

895
01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:03.051
I have admired your
work for years, amigo.

896
01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:06.513
Stealing the Moon!
Are you kidding?

897
01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:08.935
We would be unstoppable!

898
01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:11.689
Men like you, men like me.

899
01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:15.864
We should be ruling the world!

900
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.698
So, are you in?

901
01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:19.108
Woo-hoo!

902
01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:21.702
Uh, yeah, probably.

903
01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.370
Probably?

904
01:11:23.488 --> 01:11:26.116
I mean, yes, yes!
Of course, yes.

905
01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:28.998
I just have a lot
going on right now.

906
01:11:29.076 --> 01:11:31.829
I just need to get
some things off my plate

907
01:11:31.913 --> 01:11:35.213
before we start taking over
the world, that's all.

908
01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:37.210
Excuse me?
No, forget it.

909
01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:40.555
One hundred percent! I am in!

910
01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:43.762
I think...
Do you hear that? I do.

911
01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:47.558
That's Agnes calling
me from on the surface.

912
01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:51.857
Totally in!

913
01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:54.898
You know what?

914
01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:57.568
I am not so
convinced that he is in.

915
01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:11.369
Edith, Agnes, come on! Ooh!

916
01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:12.544
Oops, sorry.

917
01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.293
We need to go home now.
Where is Margo?

918
01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:15.999
But I didn't get a turn!

919
01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:23.764
Margo!

920
01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.138
Come on. We're leaving...

921
01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:28.014
Hey, what's wrong?

922
01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:29.687
I hate boys.

923
01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:34.897
Yes. They stink.

924
01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:37.195
Uh, sorry. Honey,
we got to go.

925
01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:01.795
Oops! Sorry.

926
01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:07.930
Ya!

927
01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:16.271
Hey! Pollito,
what's the matter?

928
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:17.476
Oh, hey, Eduardo!

929
01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.403
Lucia, I apologize.

930
01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:22.231
Pollito,
he's usually not like this.

931
01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:26.991
The same thing happened the
other day with Gru, and...

932
01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:33.585
Oh, well, speaking of Gru, um, have you seen him?
I really need to talk to him.

933
01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:36.833
Yes. I think he's
somewhere around here.

934
01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:38.756
You two are close, no?

935
01:13:38.873 --> 01:13:40.500
Oh, I don't know.

936
01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:43.928
I mean, "close,"
I wouldn't say we were close.

937
01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:46.005
Why, did he say we were close?
Did he say that?

938
01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:48.591
It's more what he didn't say.

939
01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:52.019
For instance,
he never mentioned

940
01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:55.223
that you were both working
for the Anti-Villain League!

941
01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:58.105
You're coming with me.

942
01:13:58.184 --> 01:13:59.231
Hey!

943
01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:01.896
Crikey!

944
01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:10.413
So, Eduardo's
actually El Macho?

945
01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:11.746
Cool!

946
01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:13.165
No, it is not cool!

947
01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.618
Plus, I pretty much
knew it was him all along,

948
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:17.703
so if anyone's cool, it's me!

949
01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:20.752
<i>Gru!</i>

950
01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:22.921
Well, Dr. Nefario.

951
01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:25.795
<i>El Macho's onto you. He knows
you're working for the AVL.</i>

952
01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:27.846
<i>And he's got your partner.</i>

953
01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:29.724
Lucy?

954
01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:33.102
That's impossible.
She's on her way to Australia!

955
01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:34.303
<i>Nefario?</i>

956
01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:35.639
<i>Sorry, gotta go.</i>

957
01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:38.858
He's got Lucy?

958
01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:41.523
Not for long.

959
01:14:41.686 --> 01:14:44.064
Come on, we're
getting her out of there.

960
01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:14.035
What was that?

961
01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:27.170
I don't see anything.

962
01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:42.189
Run!

963
01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:43.891
My unicorn!

964
01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:45.359
Agnes, no!

965
01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:21.137
Come on! Hurry!

966
01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:25.809
What's the matter?

967
01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:32.565
Bah!

968
01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:44.122
<i>Ooh l‡ l‡.</i>

969
01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:48.164
Kevin!

970
01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:52.426
Dr. Nefario! You're back!

971
01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:54.258
In the flesh.

972
01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:57.515
Behold, the antidote.

973
01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:04.851
Come on. Let's finally put this
horrible jelly to some good use.

974
01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:17.697
Ah! Ah!

975
01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:22.991
Hey, guys, come on!
Stay focused here.

976
01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:34.881
Huh?

977
01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.007
Huh?

978
01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:42.059
Uh...

979
01:18:45.846 --> 01:18:47.814
Uh...

980
01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:49.559
Oh.

981
01:19:00.819 --> 01:19:02.036
Uh,

982
01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:07.539
Curses! Foiled again!

983
01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:10.204
These guys captured me!

984
01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:43.992
Uh...

985
01:19:44.071 --> 01:19:45.368
No?

986
01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:48.288
Bah!

987
01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:49.993
Run!

988
01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:00.466
Up that tree!

989
01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:02.840
Hurry! Hurry!

990
01:21:03.901 --> 01:21:05.699
Hello, Gru!

991
01:21:05.819 --> 01:21:09.119
Hey hey!
Nice work, Dr. Nefario!

992
01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:11.371
I put an antidote in the jelly.

993
01:21:11.992 --> 01:21:15.872
I mean, I'm happy to create an
evil army to destroy the world,

994
01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:18.707
but nobody
messes with my family.

995
01:21:18.832 --> 01:21:20.834
Thank you, Doctor.

996
01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:22.882
Now, let's go get the...

997
01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:25.301
Hi!

998
01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:26.758
You brought the girls?

999
01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.183
Yes!

1000
01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:29.514
Oh.

1001
01:21:29.635 --> 01:21:31.057
Was that wrong?

1002
01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:43.615
What's happening to my minions?

1003
01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:44.782
Gru?

1004
01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:49.576
You guys, take care of
the rest of the minions.

1005
01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:51.657
I'm going to find Lucy.

1006
01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:04.594
Eat jelly, you purple freaks!

1007
01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:06.513
Whoa! Whoa!

1008
01:22:33.907 --> 01:22:35.659
It's over, El Macho.

1009
01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.081
Now, where is Lucy?

1010
01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:39.751
Let me show you.

1011
01:22:52.384 --> 01:22:53.852
Oh, hey, Gru!

1012
01:22:53.927 --> 01:22:57.431
Turns out you were right about
the whole El Macho thing, huh?

1013
01:22:57.556 --> 01:22:58.899
Yay!

1014
01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:02.979
One push of this button,
and I send that rocket

1015
01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:07.441
straight into the same volcano
where I faked my death.

1016
01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:10.490
Only this time, it's for real.

1017
01:23:10.569 --> 01:23:12.037
No!

1018
01:23:12.112 --> 01:23:13.580
Yah!

1019
01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:15.119
Tallyho!

1020
01:23:21.955 --> 01:23:25.585
We could have ruled
the world together, Gru!

1021
01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:27.545
But now,

1022
01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.593
you're gonna die.

1023
01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:55.656
Oh!

1024
01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:15.968
Ah!

1025
01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:44.755
Mmm, lipstick taser!

1026
01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:47.090
Aw, he copied me.

1027
01:24:53.338 --> 01:24:57.684
I am not afraid
of your jelly guns.

1028
01:24:57.801 --> 01:25:01.101
Oh, this ain't
a jelly gun, sunshine.

1029
01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:10.568
Ho-oh!

1030
01:25:15.235 --> 01:25:17.329
Don't worry about me,
Gru, I'll be fine.

1031
01:25:17.404 --> 01:25:19.873
I have survived
lots worse than this.

1032
01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:21.370
Okay, that's not entirely true.

1033
01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:23.498
I'm actually kind of
freaking out up here!

1034
01:25:23.577 --> 01:25:25.671
Don't worry,
I will get you out of this.

1035
01:25:34.212 --> 01:25:36.385
I really hate that chicken.

1036
01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:03.375
Is there a red one?
It's usually the red one!

1037
01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:08.747
Gru, anytime now!

1038
01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:13.218
Listen, Lucy, we may not
get out of this alive,

1039
01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:15.637
so I need to
ask you a question.

1040
01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:16.713
Uh, better make it quick.

1041
01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:20.634
If I had asked you out on a
date, what would you have said?

1042
01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:22.345
Are you kidding me?

1043
01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:23.474
Yes!

1044
01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:26.894
Jump!

1045
01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:40.996
Lucy!

1046
01:26:41.655 --> 01:26:43.908
Lucy, where are you?

1047
01:26:47.119 --> 01:26:48.336
Oh, Lucy!

1048
01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:50.293
Gru!

1049
01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:58.092
Sorry! I guess you need your
arms to tread water, huh?

1050
01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:08.311
They'll be back.

1051
01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:41.511
<i>Underwear...</i>

1052
01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:52.684
<i>Underwear...</i>

1053
01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:04.120
<i>Underwear...</i>

1054
01:28:13.538 --> 01:28:14.585
Oh!

1055
01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:22.965
Can I be
the first to say, "Ew!"

1056
01:28:24.049 --> 01:28:26.552
<i>Underwear...</i>

1057
01:28:42.192 --> 01:28:43.284
Okay.

1058
01:28:44.444 --> 01:28:45.661
Excuse me.

1059
01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:49.449
Um, hi, excuse me.

1060
01:28:57.332 --> 01:28:58.424
Uh,

1061
01:28:58.708 --> 01:29:02.463
hi, everybody.
I'd like to make some toast.

1062
01:29:02.587 --> 01:29:03.759
Uh...

1063
01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:06.220
Okay.

1064
01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:08.726
She, um...

1065
01:29:08.802 --> 01:29:13.057
She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair.

1066
01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:16.025
We love you,
mothers, everywhere.

1067
01:29:16.643 --> 01:29:19.863
And my new mom,
Lucy, is beyond compare.

1068
01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:21.281
Aww.

1069
01:29:21.398 --> 01:29:22.399
Aw.

1070
01:29:29.447 --> 01:29:31.700
To the bride and Gru!

1071
01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:53.267
Yeah!

1072
01:30:04.941 --> 01:30:07.444
Woo-hoo!
I'm so happy!

1073
01:30:17.537 --> 01:30:18.584
Huh? Ha!

1074
01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:32.010
Bah!

1075
01:30:53.031 --> 01:30:54.954
Hey, Bob! Stuart!

1076
01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:28.320
Eh!

1077
01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:29.947
No?

1078
01:31:31.861 --> 01:31:32.908
Ah!

1079
01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:37.166
Bob!

1080
01:31:44.958 --> 01:31:46.005
Uh-oh!

1081
01:32:00.223 --> 01:32:02.146
Okay.

1082
01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:31.425
Okay.

1083
01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:50.277
Aah!

1084
01:33:39.906 --> 01:33:41.658
Shh!

1085
01:33:51.626 --> 01:33:53.128
Blah.
